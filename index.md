## About Me

I'm a recent Computer Science M.S. graduate from Stanford University, where I specialized in Visual Computing — a field at the intersection of graphics, systems, and machine learning. My work focuses on computer graphics and geometric computing, and I'm especially passionate about building tools that empower creative expression and design. I enjoy working across the software stack, from numerical backends and simulation engines to interactive frontend systems.

## Updates

- **[June 2025]** Graduated from Stanford with an MSCS and a specialization in Visual Computing!
- **[Jan 2025]** Went full-time at Sileom as a software engineer, where I'm integrating our meshless FE simulation back end with [nTop](https://www.ntop.com)’s computational design front end to deliver accurate, high-fidelity static analysis results in real-time to users without them ever having to leave the design environment.
- **[Nov 2024]** Won Stanford CS Dept's Course Assistant T-Shirt Competition!
- **[Oct 2024]** Continuing graphics and simulation work at Sileom as an independent contractor.
- **[Sept 2024]** Began Autumn quarter job as Course Assistant for CS148: Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging, the highest enrolled class in Stanford's CS Dept (550 students).
- **[June 2024]** Started my summer internship as a Computer Graphics Engineer at Sileom, an early-stage startup developing state-of-the-art meshless finite element analysis simulation techniques.
- **[June 2024]** Finished Year 1 of my MSCS! Check out what I worked on below.
- **[Apr 2024]** Won Stanford CS Dept's Annual Unofficial T-Shirt and Hoodie Competition for the 2023-24 academic year! See my designs [_here_](https://movementink.bigcartel.com/product/stanford-black-shirt).
- **[Sept 2023]** Began MSCS Program at Stanford University with plans to graduate in June 2025.
- **[May 2023]** Graduated from Georgetown University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
