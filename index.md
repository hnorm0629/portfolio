## About Me

I am a Computer Science Masters student at Stanford University, where I'm pursuing an MSCS with a specialization in Visual Computing, which sits at the intersection of AI/ML, graphics, and systems. My interests lie specifically in Computer Graphics and Geometric Computing, and in developing tools to empower creativity.

## Updates

- **[Jan 2025]** Went full-time at Sileom as a software engineer, where I integrated Sileom’s immersive FE simulation backend with [nTop](https://www.ntop.com)’s CAD frontend to deliver accurate, high-fidelity static analysis results in real-time to users without them ever having to leave the design environment.
- **[Nov 2024]** Won Stanford CS Dept's Course Assistant T-Shirt Competition!
- **[Oct 2024]** Continuing graphics and simulation work at Sileom as an independent contractor.
- **[Sept 2024]** Began Autumn quarter job as Course Assistant for CS148: Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging, the highest enrolled class in Stanford's CS Dept (550 students).
- **[June 2024]** Started my summer internship as a Computer Graphics Engineer at Sileom, an early-stage startup developing state-of-the-art meshless finite element analysis simulation techniques.
- **[June 2024]** Finished Year 1 of my MSCS! Check out what I worked on below.
- **[Apr 2024]** Won Stanford CS Dept's Annual Unofficial T-Shirt and Hoodie Competition for the 2023-24 academic year! See my designs [_here_](https://movementink.bigcartel.com/product/stanford-black-shirt).
- **[Sept 2023]** Began MSCS Program at Stanford University with plans to graduate in June 2025.
- **[May 2023]** Graduated from Georgetown University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
